         <header>Main Aspiration: planning to build software professionally.</header>
         Although I am very new to coding,
         I know how happy it makes me to create something.
         I am one step further in becoming a software engineer,
         seeing as I have been accepted in the University of
         Alberta Faculty of Science - Bachelor of Specialization Computing
         Science: Software Practice.</article>

      <header> Retirement Plans</header>
       <article>Even in retirement, I hope to be employed, or doing volunteer
         work. Having “work to do” provides a lot of structure in one’s life
         (when to get up). In addition, by being of service to someone else,
         you gain useful transferable skills. After consistently taking long
         shifts at the Edmonton Food Bank, I can work efficiently for a longer
         period of time. This helps me succeed in school.</article>
