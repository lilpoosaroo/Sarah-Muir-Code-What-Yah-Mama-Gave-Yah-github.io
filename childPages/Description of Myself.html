    My name is Sarah Muir. I was born in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
    Thus, it is very lucky that my favourite season is winter. 
    Another thing that I enjoy is piano.
    One of my favourite songs to play as a child was “Misty” by Johnny Mathis.
    As I got a wee bit taller, I began to focus more on classical music instead of jazz.


    Something that has remained incredibly consistent are my favourite movies.
    “Treasure Planet”, “Atlantis: the Lost Empire”, and “The Princess and the Frog”
    have always made me gasp, and giggle no matter how many times I watch them.
