    <h1><header style="text-align:middle"> Description of Myself </header></h1>

    <br>

    <h2 class:p1> My name is Sarah Muir. I was born in Edmonton, AB, Canada.
    Thus, it is very lucky that my favourite season is winter.
    Another thing that I enjoy is piano.
    One of my favourite songs to play as a child was “Misty” by Johnny Mathis.
    As I got a wee bit taller, I began to focus more on classical music instead of jazz.</h2>

    <h2 class="p2">Something that has remained incredibly consistent are my favourite movies.
    “Treasure Planet”, “Atlantis: the Lost Empire”, and “The Princess and the Frog”
    have always made me gasp, and giggle no matter how many times I watch them. </h2>
